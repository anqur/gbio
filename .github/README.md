!!! ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§ !!!

> *Go but interface only.*

*gbio* is a(n):

* Extremely minimalistic RPC framework, toolset, runtime
* *Embedded* IDL

**NOTICE:**

ðŸ§¸ Just a toy project, also a PoC of my following ideas:

* Use a language subset/dialect as IDL, the so-called *embedded* IDL, and its out-of-the-box tools like parsers and
  pretty-printers
* Use etcd for minimalist service registry
